"""The Store protocol — the engine's single seam over persistence.

    engine ──► Store ──► {Supabase (cloud), SQLite (local)}

delapan is split into a free/local tier (SQLite + sqlite-vec, single user, no
auth) and a paid/cloud tier (Supabase: Postgres + pgvector + GoTrue + RLS). The
engine talks to this protocol instead of any one backend so the two tiers share
one engine. Return shapes are plain dicts / lists of dicts matching today's
Supabase rows; no ORM, no backend-specific objects cross this boundary.

This file defines the contract ONLY. `supabase.py` is the cloud implementation;
the engine call sites are flipped to `get_store(...)` in a later task.
